  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This baked casserole resembles a loaded baked potato, although, instead of potato, I used gnocchi and topped it with ground turkey, pasta sauce, and cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi</li>
      <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes, making sure not to overcook as meat will continue to brown in the oven. Stir in marinara sauce; remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Transfer cooked gnocchi to a 9-inch square baking dish using a slotted spoon. Top with meat sauce. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese begins to brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Serve with sour cream on the side.</li>
